<li>This is a dynamic pie chart where the user can choose variables from the drop down menu ("Closing Reasons", "Industry", and "Seniority Level"). There was a hover that showed the average days to close for each section, showing which results/types of projects had high or low average days to close. A low days to close is good, it means these job postings are being filled quickly and (hopefully) efficiently with quality candidates.</li>

<li>This is another chart created by D3 that shows more project analysis, specifically looking at each project individually based on their industry and how many days they've been open since October 2015. The user can change the axes to identify various trends in the projects.</li>
  
<h4>Waterfall Analysis</h4>

<li> Based on a user-input firm and project ID, this chart shows a waterfall plot of candidates throughout the various steps of recruitment. This is valuable to a recruiting company as it allows them to see if each level of the recruiting process is being run in an efficient manner.</li>
