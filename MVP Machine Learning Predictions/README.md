# MVP Machine Learning Predictions

<h2>Contents</h2>
<li>Worked independently to create a predictive model using gradient boosting classifiers for this seasonâ€™s Most Valuable Player award. Model generated probabilities for the testing data. Used Python, Pandas to structure the data properly, used 20 previous seasons to train the model, which generated perfect predictions. Used matplotlib to visualize.</li>

<h3>Results</h3>

<li>This shows the top 5 model generated probabilities for the American League MVP this season. The model predicts with a 99.999% likelihood that Mookie Betts will win the award, and has all 3 finalists represented in the top 5 (Manny Machado is ineligable to win the award). This seems to be a two man race, with Mike Trout representing the only significant chance of topping Betts. </li>

<li>This shows the top 5 probabilities for the National League MVP award. The model predicts with a 100% likelihood that Christian Yelich will win the award, with Javier Baez and Trevor Story coming in 2nd and 3rd, respectively. Nolan Arenado is the only finalist not represented in the top 5 of predictions (12th). </li>
