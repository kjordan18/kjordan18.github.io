<h2>Contents</h2>
<li>Worked independently to create a predictive model using gradient boosting classifiers for this seasonâ€™s Most Valuable Player award. Model generated probabilities for the testing data. Used Python, Pandas to structure the data properly, used 20 previous seasons to train the model, which generated perfect predictions. Used matplotlib to visualize.</li>

<li>This is a dynamic pie chart where the user can choose variables from the drop down menu ("Closing Reasons", "Industry", and "Seniority Level"). There was a hover that showed the average days to close for each section, showing which results/types of projects had high or low average days to close. A low days to close is good, it means these job postings are being filled quickly and (hopefully) efficiently with quality candidates.</li>

<li>This is another chart created by D3 that shows more project analysis, specifically looking at each project individually based on their industry and how many days they've been open since October 2015. The user can change the axes to identify various trends in the projects.</li>
