PROJECTS	
Bullpenning | Python, Pandas, API’s, Tableau  | GitHub  |  Live  | 	               	          
Analyzing a new trend in baseball to determine its impact on the game
Worked independently to quantitatively analyze a leading-edge trend in baseball using data gathered from Statcast API, and bullpenning’s influence on performance based statistics and team value.
Used Python, Pandas, and PyBaseball using Statcast API to collect data, used Tableau to create a dashboard to create a written report with dynamic visualizations that are easy to understand
Machine Learning MVP Predictions  | sklearn, GradientBoostingClassifier, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib  |  GitHub  
Predicting the NL and AL MVP award for each league using machine learning
Worked independently to create a predictive model using gradient boosting classifiers for this season’s Most Valuable Player award. Model generated probabilities for the testing data
Used Python, Pandas to structure the data properly, used 20 previous seasons to train the model, which generated perfect predictions. Used matplotlib to visualize.
Clockwork Application | Python, matplotlib, JSON, SQL, JavaScript, Bootstrap, D3 | GitHub  |    	       Application analyzing recruitment projects to help make business decisions  
Analyzed and gathered data from various recruiting projects through Clockwork’s 30,000+ entry SQL database using ad-hoc database queries to gather usable data for project analysis
Used Python, Pandas, matplotlib, JSON, and the Clockwork SQL database to collect and analyze project data; HTML/CSS and Bootstrap to create templates, used D3 to make dynamic visualizations and waterfall diagram; Github/Heroku to deploy.
MLB Salaries  | Scipy, LinRegress, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib  |  GitHub  |  			                
Analyzing various performance and off-field metrics and their influence on player salaries
Worked in a group of three to analyze how MLB salaries are allocated based on various on and off field metrics, and the impact of high-paid individuals on their team’s performance.
Used Python, Pandas to clean data, used Scipy to create a multi-variable linear regression model to show performance impact on salary, used matplotlib to visualize.
